## Outside resources

- [Laravel From Scratch 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYyJ4PuL4pY) Used this resource as a quick review.

- [PGP Documentation](https://www.php.net/docs.php)

- I didn't really use many outside resources. I referred to the class notes a few times, but at this point I felt confident with PHP and Laravel.


## Notes for instructor

I come from a React/Typescript background, so getting a chance to work with PHP and Laravel was very interesting. What impressed me most about Laravel was how quickly I could put together a full application (with routing, database, auth, ect) *that I could realistically deploy*. There is nothing quite like this in the Javascript ecosystem. I'm looking forward to exploring Laravel more and using it in my personal projects.

Thanks again for the great class!
